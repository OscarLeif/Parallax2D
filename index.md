### Welcome to Parallax2D!
_Parallax2D_ Is a free open source script, That allows open _Parallax_(s) in UNITY2D

### Crafting
Wrote entirely in C# (C_Sharp)to give the fastest processing and the smoothest effects in the Unity engine, No matter how many objects are _Parallax_(ed) within your scene.

### If you didn't know,
Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines. The term is derived from the Greek παράλλαξις (parallaxis), meaning "alteration". Nearby objects have a larger parallax than more distant objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.
